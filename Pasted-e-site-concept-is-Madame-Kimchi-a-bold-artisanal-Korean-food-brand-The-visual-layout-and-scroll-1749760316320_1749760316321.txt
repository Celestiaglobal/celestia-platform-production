e site concept is Madame Kimchi – a bold, artisanal Korean food brand.

The visual layout and scrolling behaviour will mirror https://www.elpaso.dev.

The code logic can apply high-level quantum web design principles (e.g., minimal UI, elegant animations, smooth transitions, spatial layering)—but nothing quantum is shown or mentioned on the site.

Edit
Build a responsive, one-page website for "Madame Kimchi" using Tailwind CSS, minimalist HTML, and JavaScript for subtle scroll animations. The layout and experience should replicate the feel and flow of https://www.elpaso.dev.

Do not include any references to quantum science on the site itself, but use design logic inspired by high-level quantum principles: clean spatial hierarchy, wave-like motion in scroll animations, smooth transitions, and minimal aesthetic focus.
